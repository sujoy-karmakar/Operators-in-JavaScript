/*Problem 3
  Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

const number = 10;
let result = (number > 0) ? "positive" : (number < 0) ? "nagative" : "Zero";

// If number 10 is gaterthan 0 then it will Positive, If number is lessthan 0 then it will nagative or number is not lessthan and
// gater than zero then it will Zero.
